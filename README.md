# LoreBubbl

LoreBubbl uses AI to help people with short attention spans get contextual awareness while reading books. This was built by Aditya, Dheeraj, Sahil, and Shravan during the Tidal Hackathon at TAMU. This repository consists of the backend aspect of the project, which includes a custom RAG pipeline, along with entity context retrieval, and the LLM connection. LoreBubbl is built using Flutter, keeping cross-platform support in mind.



<!-- A quick POC that I built. you can highlight a line or bunch of lines in an ebook online and you will be able to see similar text/context on a pop-up, from the previous pages of the book. -->
